Predictive Modeling project (PGP-DS, Great Lakes × UT Austin) | Scored 60/60
# Predictive Modeling Project (PGP-DS)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Post Graduate Program in Data Science (Great Lakes × UT Austin).  
**Score:** 60/60  
The goal was to build a linear regression model to predict **first-day content viewership** for ShowTime, an OTT media service, and identify the key drivers of performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze OTT platform data to uncover patterns in content performance  
- Build a predictive model for first-day content views  
- Provide actionable business recommendations from the model  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Methods & Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering (one-hot encoding, handling categorical variables)  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Multicollinearity check (VIF)  
- Residual Diagnostics (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence)  
- Model Evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE, MAPE)  

---

## ✅ Results
- **R² = 0.787**, strong explanatory power  
- **Test Accuracy ~91% (MAPE = 9.08%)**  
- Visitors and trailer views were the most influential predictors  
- Release timing (Wednesdays, Saturdays) boosted viewership  
- Major sports events reduced viewership significantly
